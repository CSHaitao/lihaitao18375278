### Hi there 👋  This is Haitao Li.

- 😀 I’m a first-year master student at [Tsinghua IR Group](http://www.thuir.cn/) supervised by [Prof. Yiqun Liu](http://www.thuir.cn/group/~YQLiu).
- 🏆 My research lies in Information Retrieval and Legal Case Retrieval. I currently focus on more reliable and interpretable legal case retrieval techniques with large language models. I am also very curious about dense retrieval. The publications are available at my [homepage](https://lihaitao18375278.github.io/).
